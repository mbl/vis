# Visualization Sandbox

This project contains experimental code on the quest
for fast, quality data visualization for large datasets.

My goal is to make browser-based interactive, 60fps visualizations, for as large
datasets as I can. 

The work involved includes:

- knowing what V8 does to my code
- understanding the guts of various drawing technologies
- experimenting with WebAssembly
- experimenting with non-browser technologies to get a baseline


In short, I want to know
- what is possible
- why am I not achieving it in browser
- what can I do to get closer to my goal


Even if the project turns out to be unsuccessful, it should
give me very detailed understanding of the pitfalls of
web development, as opposed to a generic non-knowledge like 
"JavaScript is slow". 

## Twitch

I am streaming my work at https://www.twitch.tv/mmbala .

Besides just coding, I hope to find some like-minded devs that I can
engage with and learn from.
