Performance

- better benchmarking
- check out Skia + WebAssembly

Read code

- look at implementation of Canvas
- assembly code generated by V8
- Chromium rendering process

Interesting
- look at QuickJS https://bellard.org/quickjs/

Visual Programming

- simple json output describing the graph
- good UX when editing
- good design
- support nodes & ports
    - node is something that does work
    - port is input/output
- do not be invasive
    - my code can be more or less independent on this visual editor
- minimal dependencies
- rendering technologies (not the end of the world)
    - webgl based (?)
    - canvas based - not SVG

Nice to have
    - integrated to an IDE

Kinds of coding
    - simple dataflow programming (chaining pure functions)
    - control flow - for loops
    - graph can be be programatically generated

Layout
    - automatically align
    - create subgraphs
    - create groups (several nodes that move together)

Nodes
    - context menu configuring the node
        - add/remove ports
    - live preview of data
    - collapse/expand node
    - quickly create - search for node context menu?
    - detailed attributes page support
    - display status

Ports
    - color-coded by type
    - collapse/expand Vec4 -> 4 components and back
